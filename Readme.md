# Weather API 

## Description
- As my journey of building one project per month continues, I have decided to add the weather API
- This project shows how I'm able to consume external API's. In this case I consumed [Open-API](https://openweathermap.org/ "Open-API")
- This projects enables individuals to know about the current weather condition in a particular region
- I used [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/ "Axios") to consume the external API
